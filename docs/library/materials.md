# Materials
GBH materials are divided into two types: those used for mesh-based hair and those used for strand-based hair. You can distinguish them by their namesâ€”materials for mesh-based hair start with "M_C," while those for strand-based hair start with "M_S".

## M_C_Checker
This material's primary purpose is to check the UV mapping of the hair.
