## Settings 
You can access the library's settings by clicking on the gear icon.

- **Add Node Groups to Active Object in Viewport:** Adds selected node groups to the active object(s) in the 3D viewport, rather than requiring a specific hair object selection.
- **Automatically Pack Resources:** Automatically embeds all external files into the current .blend file, keeping everything self-contained.
- **Select Personal Directory:** Choose a directory to load node groups from .blend files into your library.
