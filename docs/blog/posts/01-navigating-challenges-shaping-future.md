# GBH Tool: Navigating Challenges and Shaping the Future

2024 has been a challenging year for GBH Tool's development. Personal matters slowed progress to a crawl, leaving many things incomplete. Since GBH Tool was offered for free, I couldn’t allocate the time it needed for further development. Unfortunately, continuing for free is no longer feasible, which is why GBH Tool is now a paid tool.

You can still access the tool for testing on my GitHub, but its future depends on the support from sales. That's why it's now available on both [Gumroad](https://gixo.gumroad.com/l/GBHTool) and [BlenderMarket](https://blendermarket.com/products/gbhtool).

A lot of improvements and enhancements have been made to the tool in the new version, and the documentation site has been redone, providing better quality. We've also added separate buttons for bug reports and feature requests in the add-on’s info panel, handled through GitHub. If you prefer not to use GitHub, you can always reach out via [email](mailto:GixoXYZ@proton.me), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TxTpJ8FQaz) or any other social media platform listed in the footer.

I hope you understand that these changes are necessary for the project's survival, and I wish you all the best in using the tool to create amazing things!
