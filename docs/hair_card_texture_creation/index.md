## Start creating textures
To begin creating hair card textures, first select the desired texture quality (you can change the quality later), then click "Create Texturing Scene".

This will create a new scene in your .blend file, allowing you to create new hair objects and render them as textures.

## Creating hair objects
All hair curves and curve objects in the scene are listed in the "Hair Objects" section.
You can quickly create empty curve objects using "Add Empty Curve" or by using Blender's native object creation method. You can then use the draw curve tool in edit mode to quickly create the base.
