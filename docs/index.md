GBH Tool is a generative hair add-on for Blender. This add-on offers multiple hair generation options, allowing you to create hair as strands, hair cards, or stylized hair. With over 40 pre-made node groups available in its library, as well as the ability to use Blender's new node groups and load your own node groups from your files, the add-on offers plenty of flexibility for customizing your workflow. Additionally, the add-on includes features such as hair conversion and hair rigging, with more features to come.
