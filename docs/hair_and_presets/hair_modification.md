# Hair Modification

After selecting the hair object, a new section called "Hair Modifications" will appear.

In this section, all of the hair object's modifiers are displayed. Selecting each modifier will reveal its relevant inputs and outputs.

As you can see, this add-on can display float curves and color ramps as inputs in the modification panel. Head over to [here](../library/node_groups.md/#using-your-own-node-groups) to learn how to modify your own node groups to utilize this feature.

## Adding/removing modifiers
Modifiers can be removed one by one using the minus button or all at once with the "Delete All Modifiers" button.

A geometry nodes modifier can be added to the hair object using the [library panel](../library/ui.md/#importing-and-adding-items-to-objects) or by clicking the plus button in the "Hair Modifications" panel. This will add an empty geometry nodes modifier to the selected hair object, allowing you to select the desired node group.
