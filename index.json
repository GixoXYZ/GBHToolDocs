In this example we're using hair curves. To create hair curves, select the surface object and then press \u0026quot;Shift\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;A\u0026quot; on keyboard. From the pop up menu select empty hair under curve category. To add guide hair curves and groom them change to \u0026quot;Sculpt Mode\u0026quot; You can add guide hair curves and groom them using the tools located in the Toolbar. Selecting hair object by add-on After adding guide hair curves we need to select the hair object in the add-on's panel. Applying a preset to hair object We can start adding node groups to the object from library or quickly apply presets to our hair object. To apply presets we need to select an item from presets list and click on apply. Note that applying a preset to an object clears its existing node groups and modifiers.\rHair object's node groups and modifications Applying a preset loads a list of geometry nodes modifiers with their relative node groups into the hair object. Assigned node groups to the object are listed in the section marked by \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; in the image below. Selecting each node group from the list loads its controls in the section marked by \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; in the image below. Using GBH library It's possible to add more node groups from the library after applying a preset, but in this case we use the library to load an example material and add it to our hair object. Changing hair's material In Blender 3.5 and later we can assign the material to the hair object using the option in the properties panel, but in this example we use \u0026quot;GBH Set Material\u0026quot; node group by selecting it in the hair modifications section and then selecting the material in the controls section. We can use materials with procedural colors or textures for our hair object. The material we used in this example uses this texture for coloring the hair. As you can see the pink/purple color hue is located in the last third of the texture. In order to get the purple color we need to mode the UV mapping of the hair curves which is easily done with GBH UV node group.
