This add-on offers multiple hair generation options, allowing you to create hair as strands, hair cards, or stylized hair. With over 40 pre-made node groups available in its library, as well as the ability to use Blender's new node groups and load your own node groups from your files, the add-on offers plenty of flexibility for customizing your workflow. Additionally, the add-on includes features such as hair conversion and hair rigging, with more features to come.</p> <p>Contact Info</p> <p>Feel free to contact me on Twitter, via email or message on Discord server to report problems or request new feature(s).</p> <p>Getting Started </p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/10/23/gbh-tool-navigating-challenges-and-shaping-the-future/","title":"GBH Tool: Navigating Challenges and Shaping the Future","text":"<p>2024 has been a challenging year for GBH Tool's development. Personal matters slowed progress to a crawl, leaving many things incomplete. Since GBH Tool was offered for free, I couldn\u2019t allocate the time it needed for further development. Unfortunately, continuing for free is no longer feasible, which is why GBH Tool is now a paid tool.</p> <p>You can still access the tool for testing on my GitHub, but its future depends on the support from sales. That's why it's now available on both Gumroad and BlenderMarket.</p> <p>A lot of improvements and enhancements have been made to the tool in the new version, and the documentation site has been redone, providing better quality. We've also added separate buttons for bug reports and feature requests in the add-on\u2019s info panel, handled through GitHub. If you prefer not to use GitHub, you can always reach out via email, Discord or any other social media platform listed in the footer.</p> <p>I hope you understand that these changes are necessary for the project's survival, and I wish you all the best in using the tool to create amazing things!</p>"},{"location":"convert_hair/","title":"Convert Hair","text":""},{"location":"convert_hair/#ui","title":"UI","text":""},{"location":"convert_hair/#to-mesh","title":"To mesh","text":"<p>Suitable for converting stylized or card-based hair into a mesh object for export to other software, such as game engines.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"convert_hair/#to-curve","title":"To curve","text":"<p>Suitable for converting groomed hair curves into curve objects, providing more control over the tilt and scale of the curves when creating stylized or card-based hair.</p> <p>Controls:</p> <ul> <li>Curve Points: Number of segments each curve will have after conversion.</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"convert_hair/#to-hair-curves","title":"To hair curves","text":"<p>Suitable for converting curve objects into hair curves or applying all hair curve modifiers to create a new object.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"convert_hair/#attach-hair-curves-to-surface","title":"Attach hair curves to surface","text":"<p>Suitable for attaching hair curve objects to a mesh object by selecting the mesh object and its UV map.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"convert_hair/#particle-systems-to-hair-curves","title":"Particle systems to hair curves","text":"<p>Suitable for converting hair particle systems into hair curves.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"convert_hair/#to-particle-systemdeprecated","title":"To particle system(deprecated)","text":"<p>Not recommended for use, as it will be replaced by Blender's new hair system in the future.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>This feature only converts the active hair curve object in the viewport, so make sure to select the hair object first.</p> <p></p> <p>Options:</p> <ul> <li>Parent Object: The object to which the hair will be added as a particle system.</li> <li>Parent's UV Map: The UV map of the parent object.</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"getting_started/","title":"Getting Started","text":"<ul> <li> Download \u2013 Download sources</li> <li> Installation \u2013 Installation process</li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting_started/download/","title":"Download","text":"<p>Download the GBH Tool from the following platforms:</p> <p>Download from Gumroad  Download from Blender Market  </p> <p>Info</p> <p>Download updates directly through the GBH Tool.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/installation/","title":"Installation","text":"<ul> <li>Open Blender and click \"Edit\" in the top bar.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>In the \"Edit\" menu, click \"Preferences\".</li> </ul> <ul> <li>In \"Preferences\", go to the \"Get Extensions\" section.
